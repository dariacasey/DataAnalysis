# Regression Analysis

The contents of this repository pertain to the analysis of simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. I used R and RStudio to conduct an analysis on a given dataset, where I predicted sales using one or more predictor variables. During this analysis, I identified a singular predictor within the dataset that demonstrated a high level of accuracy in sales prediction. Subsequently, I constructed and fitted the SLR model to this predictor, generating associated plots and calculating metrics such as regression standard error and coefficient of determination to conduct model interpretation.

After establishing the SLR model, I proceeded to develop a MLR model, interpreting it through the utilization of plots, the model summary, and various measures, mirroring the approach taken with the SLR. I then conducted a comparative analysis of the two models to determine which one exhibited a better fit to the data. Additionally, I generated 95% confidence and prediction intervals for the more efficient model.

Attached is my R file as well as my project report that includes all the models generated, detailed interpreations, and specific outputs from the data.
